I have a contact who is able to get into the system.
These are the grades my friend found for the flag man.
A lot of his information was wiped from the system halfway through September.

Also some additional contextual information:
Spring 2024
  - He worked as a 911 Dispatcher 6 nights per week and 10 hours per day in Gloucester County, NJ.
  - He let his old high school principal's house burn down.
  - He napped during the day and got chewed out for it majorly.

Fall 2024
  - He was the team leader for his Undergrad Senior Project. That was a horrible mistake.
  - He was also an Evaluation Assistant for a Databases course per his LinkedIn.
